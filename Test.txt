We have converted the PWA into a Java web application with MySQL. Now, to access the application, you need to deploy it on a server (like Tomcat) and then access it via a web browser.

Steps to Access the Application:
Prerequisites:

Java 11 or above installed

Apache Maven installed

MySQL server installed and running

Tomcat server (or any other Java servlet container)

Database Setup:

Create a database named case_tracker in MySQL.

Run the provided SQL script to create the cases table.

Configuration:

Update the database connection details in DatabaseUtil.java (URL, username, password).

Build the Application:

Navigate to the project root directory (where pom.xml is located).

Run the command: mvn clean package

This will generate a WAR file in the target directory.

Deploy the WAR file:

Deploy the generated WAR file to your Tomcat server. You can do this by copying the WAR file to the webapps directory of Tomcat.

Start Tomcat:

Start the Tomcat server. If you are using the default configuration, the application will be available at http://localhost:8080/casetracker (assuming the WAR file is named casetracker.war).

Access the Application:

Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/casetracker

Note:
If you are using an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) for development, you can run the project directly from the IDE by configuring a Tomcat server.

The application uses JSP and Servlets, so it must be run in a servlet container.

The frontend (JSP) uses the same CSS and JavaScript as the original PWA, so the user experience should be very similar.

Important:
Make sure that the MySQL server is running and accessible with the credentials provided in DatabaseUtil.java.

The application does not include the PWA features (like service worker and manifest) because it is now a traditional web application. However, the UI and functionality are preserved.

If you face any issues during deployment, check the Tomcat logs for errors, and ensure that the database connection is properly configured.

After deploying the Java web application, here's how to access and use it:

1. Accessing the Application
URL: http://localhost:8080/casetracker

Default Access Points:
Main Application: http://localhost:8080/casetracker

Direct API Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/casetracker/cases

2. Step-by-Step Access Guide
Step 1: Start Required Services
bash
# Start MySQL (Windows)
net start mysql

# Start MySQL (Linux/Mac)
sudo systemctl start mysql

# Start Tomcat (Windows - if using Tomcat as service)
net start tomcat9

# Start Tomcat (Linux/Mac)
sudo systemctl start tomcat9

# Or start Tomcat from bin directory
cd /path/to/tomcat/bin
./startup.sh
Step 2: Deploy the Application
bash
# Build the application
mvn clean package

# Copy WAR file to Tomcat webapps directory
cp target/casetracker.war /path/to/tomcat/webapps/
Step 3: Access in Browser
Open your web browser and navigate to:

text
http://localhost:8080/casetracker

4. Database Configuration
Update DatabaseUtil.java with your MySQL credentials:

java
public class DatabaseUtil {
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/case_tracker";
    private static final String USERNAME = "your_mysql_username";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "your_mysql_password";
    // ...
}
5. Troubleshooting Common Issues
Application Not Loading:
bash
# Check if Tomcat is running
http://localhost:8080

# Check application deployment
http://localhost:8080/manager/html
Database Connection Issues:
sql
-- Verify database exists
SHOW DATABASES;

-- Verify table structure
USE case_tracker;
DESCRIBE cases;

-- Test with sample data
INSERT INTO cases (id, case_number, court_name, case_type, party_name, case_status, next_hearing_date) 
VALUES ('test_001', 'CNR/KA/2024/001', 'High Court of Karnataka', 'Civil', 'John Doe', 'Pending', '2024-12-31');
Port Conflicts:
bash
# Check what's running on port 8080
netstat -ano | findstr :8080  # Windows
lsof -i :8080                 # Linux/Mac

# Change Tomcat port in server.xml if needed
# Edit /path/to/tomcat/conf/server.xml
6. Testing the Application
Test Case Creation:
Fill the form with sample data:

Case Number: CNR/KA/2024/001

Court Name: High Court of Karnataka

Case Type: Civil

Party Name: Test Party

Status: Pending

Next Hearing Date: 2024-12-31

Click "Add Case"

Verify case appears in the list

Test Search:
Type "Civil" in search box

Verify filtering works

7. API Endpoints (for advanced use)
The application provides REST API endpoints:

Method	Endpoint	Purpose
GET	/casetracker/cases	Get all cases
GET	/casetracker/cases?search=query	Search cases
GET	/casetracker/cases?action=view&id=123	Get specific case
POST	/casetracker/cases	Add new case
PUT	/casetracker/cases	Update case
DELETE	/casetracker/cases?id=123	Delete case
8. Production Deployment
For production environment:

Environment Variables:
Create a configuration file or use environment variables for database credentials.

Database Connection Pool:
Consider using Tomcat connection pool in context.xml:

xml
<Resource name="jdbc/caseTrackerDB"
          auth="Container"
          type="javax.sql.DataSource"
          maxTotal="100" maxIdle="30" maxWaitMillis="10000"
          username="your_username" password="your_password"
          driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
          url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/case_tracker"/>
9. Security Considerations
Change default credentials in DatabaseUtil.java

Add input validation on server side

Consider adding authentication for multi-user access

Use HTTPS in production

Quick Start Script (Linux/Mac)
Create a start-app.sh file:

bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting Case Tracker Application..."

# Start MySQL
sudo systemctl start mysql
echo "MySQL started"

# Wait for MySQL to be ready
sleep 5

# Start Tomcat
sudo systemctl start tomcat9
echo "Tomcat started"

echo "Application will be available at: http://localhost:8080/casetracker"
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop"
Expected Output After Successful Deployment
When you access http://localhost:8080/casetracker, you should see:

‚úÖ A professional blue-themed interface

‚úÖ "DR RaviKumar H S (ORTHO) Case Tracker" header

‚úÖ Working case entry form

‚úÖ Empty cases list (initially)

‚úÖ Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

The application is now ready to manage your legal cases with persistent MySQL storage!
